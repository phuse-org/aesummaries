## **1. Overview**

CVARS application helps to explore data visually and makes it easier to identify interesting data patterns.

By uploading data locally or can use default CDISC data, user can explore relevant tables, listings, and figures by giving their own inputs, thus interacting with the data and the analysis.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cvars1look.png")
```

This is the look and feel of the CVARS application initially when one loads the app. Now that the app is ready to use, the user needs to feed in the data for which the report and graphs are visualized. There are 5 tabs in the main window: `Report Inputs` to give inputs for reports, `Files & Lot` to show the list of available datasets for the selected study, `Data Check` to view the reported values for the selected variable, `Graph Output` to display any graph generated, and `Table Output` to display any table generated.

|     |


### 1.1 Data Import

Data can be uploaded from *Local* location. The file can only be of ".csv", ".sas7bdat", ".xpt" and ".Rda" format and must follow the naming convention of "adXX" where "XX" is the domain code. For example, "adae.sas7bdat" and "adae.xpt" are valid whereas "adae_s1.sas7bdat" or "adae2.sas7bdat" are not valid. In the *Data Source* panel, you can see the following options: Default, and Local.

|     |
|-----|
|     |



#### 1.1.1 Default CDISC data

This option provides an opportunity to work with the built-in dataset in the CVARS application. Default option includes ADSL and ADAE dataset. For example, to start working with "ADSL" dataset, choose "ADSL" from C`DISC ADaM Data` dropdown and then click on "Read Data".

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adaereadpic.png")
```

Before process or create a report, click on "Report Inputs" tab. This step provides available options to create or process a report. 

|     |

|     |

## **2. Reports**

Once the data has been read, the app processes the domain name and allows you to choose the corresponding reports available for those domains.

|     |

**Note**:  Before proceeding to this section, it is highly recommended to review sections `1.1 Data Import` and `1.1.1 Default CDISC data` for further details about giving report inputs.

### 2.1 Volcano and Forest

Once `ADAE` data is uploaded, user will have drop-down with Volcano and Forest reports available. Both Volcano and Forest reports yield a Graph Output and a Table Output (common to both, more later)

Data import, Report Selection and Treatment variable Selection


|     |
|-----|
|     |

#### 2.1.1 Volcano Plot


This section presents detailed the steps for creating Volcano Plot using CVARS application which is a graph report. The required input `ADaM` data for this is an `ADAE` dataset.


Upon loading the CVARS  application, please select the `Data Source`and load the `ADAE` data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adaeenter.png")
```

Upon loading/selecting `ADAE` data and clicking the Report Inputs tab, report inputs can be added.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("adae_report_input.png")
```

  - Report Type as `Figure` and Report Name as `Volcano Plot` for the graph  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_plot_new_1.png")
```

**Treatment/Population**  
*Required*  

  - Under Treatment and Population Selection, select appropriate `Treatment Variable`:   
    For table, Treatment Variable determines the columns and for Figure, determines how to         differentiate groups by color.
    
  - Select appropriate `Treatment Sort Variable` which will give the order for sorting             Treatment variable.
  
  - To subset entire data based on population flags, select `Population Filter`. eg. Overall,      Safety (SAFFL).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_02.PNG")
```


**Processing Data:**  

  - Add or Edit the default `Analysis Subset Condition` and `Denominator Subset Condition` to      filter input data (for calculating categorical counts alone or for entire data                 respectively)
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("event_analysis_03.PNG")
```

  - Select `Adverse Event Filter(s)` - To filter input data

  - Select `Period` - To generate the figure by either `Overall Duration` or `Other`.
  
  - Select `Summary By` - It helps to select either `Participants` if the plot is to based on subject count or `Events` if the plot is to based on AE counts.
  
  - Select `Lower Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by           AEBODSYS or FMQ Name etc., It is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P-value) versus magnitude of change (fold change).
  
  - Select `Lower Level Event Term` - This variable will help to generate the figure by           AEDECOD or AELLT etc., It is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P-value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). 
  
  - select `Measure of Association` - To generate the plot by either `Risk Ratio` or `Risk Difference`.
  
  - Select `Control Group` - To choose the control treatment to compare with treatment 
  
  - Select `Treatment Group` - To choose the treatment to compare with control
 
  - Update the `p Value Cutoff`, `Alpha Value(CI)`, `Risk Reference Lines` and `Cutoff of Incidence (%)` as desired to generate the plot. 
 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_plot_02.PNG")
```

**Graph Output:**

- Click `Process Report Input` button and switch to `Graph Output` tab to generate the graph.

knitr::include_graphics("adae_treatment.png")
```
  
**Data Pre-processing/Preparation**  
*Optional - Can use defaults*

  - `Analysis Subset Condition` is the filter condition for the data to get counts of participants/events for each treatment.  
  - `Denominator Subset Condition` is the filter condition for the data to calculate percentages of participants/events for each treatment.  
  - `Adverse Event Filter(s)` , select which adverse events are to be filtered for analysis from the list available in the data.  
  - `Period` drop-down to filter the required time period alone select 'Overall Period' to take entire data or 'Other' to specify the residual period (in days) to cut off.    
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

```
    
 - `Control Group` - Select treatment value within Treatment Variable to use as control for analysis  
 - `Treatment Group` - Select treatment value(s) to perform pair-wise analysis against Control. Selecting multiple treatments will result in displaying multiple pairs, eg. Control-Treatment1 and Control-Treatment2 pairs in this case.  
 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("forest_trtgroup.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("forest_graphdisp.png")
```


**Graph Output**  

For selected options, visualize Forest Plot in Graph Output tab. Note that the color legend identifies the risk pairs in forest graph as well as p-value columns. In the incidence scatterplot, certain points are also depicted with larger green and red points which denotes a statistically significant (per p value cutoff) lower or higher incidence % respectively, for the treatment group vs control.

## **3. Save Reports**

All the tables and graphs generated can be saved outside of the application. After an output is generated, below 'Process Report Input ' button you will see 'Save'.

Table can be saved in 3 formats wherease Figure in 5 formats. HTML will contain the plot as an interactive widget.

After selecting a format and Table/Figure, click the 'Save' button and you will be able to download the selected report into a local path. In future this will expand to save in network locations.

## **4. Usage Notes and Common Errors**

-   When subset conditions, population or adverse event filters are selected, check that there is any data within those filters. If not, reports may fail or display a message that there is no data.

-   For running an analysis with pooled data, user has the option to give STUDYID as Treatment Variable.

-   If the app fails at some point, the 'Logs' in R Studio Connect or R Studio can also give a clue about the source of the error.
